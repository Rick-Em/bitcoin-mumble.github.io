title: Visa-based Bitcoin cards being restricted (ShakePay) & stopped (ANXPRO)
author: sirmeow

Two Bitcoin debit/pre-paid card programs seem to have been affected by regulations or license restrictions and are being forced to stop or restrict their card offerings.

Yesterday [Shakepay](https://shakepay.co) sent an email regarding the change. They are forced to serve only the European Territory (45 countries), while they used to serve [135 countries](http://web.archive.org/web/20170610151913/https://help.shakepay.co/visa-debit-card/what-countries-can-shakepay-issue-to) among which were Australia and Canada, although not USA.

Today the second case is, [ANXPRO.com](https://anxpro.com/pages/card) who sent the following email. Effectively cancelling their Elite Program which was a Visa pre-paid card, while their Premium program which is Mastercard-based looks still alive.

You probably noticed the same deadline of October 15th, 2017 for both cases and it make sense since both were Visa-based which forced the changes.

ShakePay is quite respectable, not sure about ANXPRO, but there are certainly more shady Bitcoin pre-paid/virtual cards that are probably getting similar treatment on restricting them.

tl;dr Visa starts to be more stringent around enabling Bitcoin-based products.

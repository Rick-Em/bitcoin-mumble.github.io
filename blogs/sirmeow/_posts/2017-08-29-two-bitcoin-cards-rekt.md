title: Visa-based Bitcoin cards being restricted (ShakePay) & stopped (ANXPRO)

Two Bitcoin debit/pre-paid cards seem to have been affected by regulation or license restrictions and being forced to stop or restrict their card offerings to either stop or restrict their client-list to specific territories.

First, [ANXPRO.com](https://anxpro.com/pages/card) sent the following email. Effectively cancelling their Elite Program which was a Visa pre-aid card, while it the Premium program which is Mastercard-based looks still alive.

The second case is [Shakepay](https://shakepay.co), who were forced to serve only the European Territory. They used to serve 135 countries among which were Australia, Canada, although not USA.

You probably noticed the same deadline of October 15th, 2017 for both cases and their announcements had a day difference.

ShakePay is quite respectable, not sure about ANXPRO, but there are certainly more shady Bitcoin pre-paid/virtual cards that are probably getting similar treatment on restricting them.

tl;dr Visa starts to be more stringent around enabling Bitcoin-based products.

The target was to have a multi-user blogspace.

One idea was to use Github Pages which provides free hosting for open-source repos.

Github supports Jekyll as a static site generator. There was a challenge with the author indexes for which I was using a plugin by the [Artsy engineers](https://github.com/artsy/artsy.github.io), but Github doesn't allow custom plugins for Github Pages.

So the solution was to use [CircleCI](https://circle.com) and push the compiled site version to Github & branch `master`, while we (users) when adding a new blog post or edit the site push to the `source` branch.

Now you have a serverless solution for free which still being flexible enough for a lot of things.

##### How it works:
(do changes) -> (PR/push to `source`) -> (merge) -> [CircleCI compiles] -> [pushes to `master`] -> Published
